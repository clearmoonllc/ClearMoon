## We're moving!

### Hey there!
We've begun rebuilding our internal PM software to a fully-loaded Ruby-on-Rails environment, powered by [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/).
And as you can see, we're also rebuilding our web front-end. The two will be seamlessly combined into a refined, responsive UI.

As a collective, we're now pushing for a more Open Internet, starting with our own back-end stack and platform.
We'll be releasing our own edits and running environments as [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) repositories.


### Security & Privacy
Client data, metrics, and private/corporate information will be stored in a closed-software environment, as our one exception. 

**The security and privacy of our clients and their information is our first priority, it always will be.**


### Current Status
*Our in-progress upgrade will enable our full lab & hosting environments, and a few new ESXi and Kubernetes deployments.*
