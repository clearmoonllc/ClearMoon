## We're moving!

### Hey there!
We've begun rebuilding our internal PM software to a fully-loaded Ruby-on-Rails environment, powered by [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/).
And as you can see, we're also rebuilding our web front-end. The two will be seamlessly combined into a refined, responsive UI.

As a collective, we're now pushing for a more Open Internet, starting with our own back-end stack and platform.
We'll be releasing our own edits and running environments as [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) repositories.


### Security & Privacy
Client data, metrics, and private/corporate information will be stored in a closed-software environment, as our one exception. 

**The security and privacy of our clients and their information is our first priority.**


### Current Status
**Update 11/04:** *Our in-progress upgrade will enable our full lab & hosting environments, and a few new ESXi and Kubernetes deployments.*

**Update 11/13:** *Rack has been deployed into our new hosting company! Two of our hypervisors will be assembled and deployed by end of Jan 2021. Until then, our lab environment will not be publicly accessible.*

**Update 11/24:** *We've gotten our Microsoft Partnership and have begun development of our Azure Cloud deployment, we can now directly license our 365 clients.*

**Update 11/30:** *Our AWS Partnership has been established, and we're moving our data storage systems onto an S3 block-enabled system throughout this week! DRaaS clients will now have 3 datacenter location backups.*

**Update 12/22:** *Initial Cloud deplyoments are beginning next month!*

**Update 1/13:** *Redmine should be back online by 1/27. We're also looking into using full CI software package delivery systems.*
